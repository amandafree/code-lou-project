To run:
  1. git clone https://github.com/amandafree/code-lou-project
  2. Go to the root directory of the project
  3. npm install --save express
  4. npm install --save angular
  5. npm install --save body-parser
  6. npm install --save mongoose
  7. mongod
  8. open a second tab
  9. nodemon (or node src/app.js)
  10. In a browser, go to http://localhost:3000
  11. Add, edit, and delete goals as needed
