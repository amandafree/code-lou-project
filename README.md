This is my Code Louisville FSJS Project. It's a fitness goal tracker that lets you create, edit, delete, and mark goals complete as they're met. 

To run:
  git clone https://github.com/amandafree/code-lou-project
  Go to the root directory of the project
  npm install --save express
  npm install --save angular
  npm install --save body-parser
  npm install --save mongoose
  npm install --save webpack
  mongod
  open a second tab
  nodemon (or node app.js)
  In a browser, go to http://localhost:3000
  Add, edit, and delete goals as needed
